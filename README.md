# HCG, a Hierarchical DNA-based Classifier for Gastric Cancer Molecular Subtyping


## Introduction

This repository is code dedicated to the testing data of HCG, a classifier which have good performance in identifying the intrinsic subtypes of gastric cancer. Leveraging three multi-omics (mutation, CNA, methylation and expression) datasets from TCGA, we developed a DNA-level predictive model, which we termed HCG (Hierarchical DNA-based Classifier for Gastric Cancer Molecular Subtyping) using hierarchical stepwise learning method.

The required dependency is R and Python.

The code is contained in <code.md>; the data details are shown in <The_data_for_HCG.md>.
